        // okay for loop is the basic loop we all start learning in start it use systax like for(int i = 0;i<=length;i++) like this it indicates that start of loop and for which lenght it will run and counter also increase there as well but in while loop things are different we create it using while(condition) and then we use increment condition inside {} while block, for do while it runs the code inside it in first run later it check the condition in while(condition); this is the difference between them also there is one more loop called for each hehe
